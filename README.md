# Developing-reservoir-computing-models-for-anticipatory-synchronizationDeveloping reservoir computing models for anticipatory synchronization with chaotic time series and real-time prediction

This is the code for the results and figures in our paper "Developing reservoir computing 
models for anticipatory synchronization with chaotic time series and real-time prediction". 
They are written in Matlab, and require recent versions of MATLAB R2024b.

The directories:
/Fig1/ -> computing data for Roessler system;
/Fig2/ -> computing data for Lorenz system;
/Fig3/ -> computing data for electronic chaos oscillator;
/Fig4/ -> computing data for QIF neurons;

The main subdirectories:
/Fig1/Figure/ -> plotting graph for Roessler system;
/Fig2/Figure/ -> plotting graph for Lorenz system;
/Fig3/Figure/ -> plotting graph for Electronic chaos oscillator;
/Fig4/Figure/ -> plotting graph for QIF neurons.
